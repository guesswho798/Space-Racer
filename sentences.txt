In the classical theory of gravity, which is based on real space-time, the universe can either have existed for an infinite time or else it had a beginning at a singularity at some finite time in the past, the latter possibility of which, in fact, the singularity theorems indicate, although the quantum theory of gravity, on the other hand, suggests a third possibility in which it is possible for space-time to be finite in extent and yet to have no singularities that formed a boundary or edge because one is using Euclidean space-times, in which the time direction is on the same footing as directions in space.
A computer memory is basically some device that can be in either one of two states, an example of which is a superconducting loop of wire where, if there is an electric current flowing in the loop, it will continue to flow because there is no resistance while, on the other hand, if there is no current, the loop will continue without a current two states of memory that can be labelled one and zero.
Before Darwin, American scientists typically accepted the biblically orthodox view that God directly created every type of species, with each thereafter reproducing true to form. In contrast, Darwin proposed that the interaction of several biological mechanisms naturally caused some descendants of older species gradually to evolve over countless generations into the ancestors of new species.
After a series of near misses and the imposition of lesser restrictions in several places, in 1925, Tennesee became the first state to outlaw evolutionary teaching.

In the ensuing trial of science teacher John Scopes, Bryan successfully sparred with Clarence Darrow, who represented the defendant, over science, religion, and academic freedom.
Typically, legislators showed greater responsiveness to popular opinion than judges, but even the courts operated within parameters established by popular sentiment, never allowing public science to deviate too far from popular opinion, a reconciliation in which both legislators and judges avoided ruling on the scientific merits of evolution or creation, which they typically viewed as being beyond the scope of their competence and based their decisions on non-scientific factors, such as the religious nature of creationism or the social ramifications of evolutionary teaching, inevitably influenced by scientific opinion only to the extent that opinion was distilled through popular opinion either directly in the acceptance of a theory of origins or indirectly in the cultural respect afforded science generally.
